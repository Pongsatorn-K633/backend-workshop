Vue 3 and React are two of the most popular frontend frameworks. But which one is right for your project? Let’s compare them:

## 1. Learning Curve
- Vue 3 is more beginner-friendly with a simple syntax.
- React has a steeper learning curve due to JSX and state management.

## 2. Performance
Both Vue 3 and React are highly optimized, but Vue’s reactivity system provides automatic optimizations.

## 3. Ecosystem
- React has a larger ecosystem with more third-party libraries.
- Vue has official solutions like Vue Router and Pinia for state management.

## 4. Community Support
React has a larger developer base, but Vue’s community is growing rapidly.
