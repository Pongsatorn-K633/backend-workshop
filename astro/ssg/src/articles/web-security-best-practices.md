Web security is crucial for protecting user data and maintaining trust. Here are some best practices:

## 1. Use HTTPS
Always secure your website with HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.

## 2. Implement Proper Authentication
Use strong authentication methods like OAuth, JWT, or multi-factor authentication (MFA).

## 3. Prevent SQL Injection
Use parameterized queries or an ORM to prevent SQL injection attacks.

## 4. Secure Cookies
Set HTTP-only, Secure, and SameSite attributes on cookies to protect against CSRF and XSS attacks.

## 5. Validate User Input
Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities.
